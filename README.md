# Minesweeper

This is a modified version of the popular minesweeper game.

# How to Play

First you have to choose the difficulty of the game.
The options are:

- Easy
  - Size = 5 x 5
  - Mines = 10
- Intermediate
  - Size = 10 x 10
  - Mines = 30
- Hard
  - Size = 15 x 15
  - Mines = 70

After selection the game will start. First it asks to select a row, and after that it asks to select a column. If there's a mine, you will lose the game, and if there's not a mine, the game will continue until you hit the mine or you clear whole board and win the game.

# Note

This version of the minesweeper always opens 3 x 3 area.
